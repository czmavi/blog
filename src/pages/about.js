    <p>I've started my programming career back in the days of ASP.NET Webforms 2.0 and jQuery for the front-end. Since then I was following the .NET road upgrading to the new Webforms versions until the ASP.NET MVC came. </p>
    <p>I've switched to MVC when the ASP.NET MVC 3 came out and I've soon added the Web API.</p>
    <p>My latest change is with the front-end where I'm starting to get in love with React.js and the Redux application architecture.</p>
    <p>As a developer I'm respecting SOLID principles, I'm using (and I want to continue using) IoC/DI, unit testing, continuous integration etc.</p>
